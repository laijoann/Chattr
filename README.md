# Chattr

## Goal
Chattr is primarily a client-side SPA (single-page app) built with ReactJS. It contains a chat log displaying messages and notifications, an input field to change your name, and an input field to send a message. The client-side app communicates with a server via WebSockets for multi-user real-time updates.

## Features
- use command __/gif__ _keyword_ to get a random gif from giphy
- __:__ _emoji-command_ __:__ to use emojis
- display images when image links are entered
- use command __/garfield__ to get a random garfield comic strip

## Stack
- React
- Webpack with Babel, JSX, ES6, webpack dev server (comes with boilerplate)
- WebSockets using Node package ws on the server-side, and native WebSocket on client side
