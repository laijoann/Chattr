# Chattr

## Functional Requirements
Chattr is primarily a client-side SPA (single-page app) built with ReactJS. It contains a chat log displaying messages and notifications, an input field to change your name, and an input field to send a message. The client-side app communicates with a server via WebSockets for multi-user real-time updates. No persistent database is involved; the focus is on the client-side experience.
